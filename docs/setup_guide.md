# Zodiac Reality Module Setup Guide

This guide shows how to setup the Reality Module with a Gnosis Safe on the Rinkeby testnetwork. It will use [Reality.eth](https://realit.io/) and can be used with [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/).

The Reality Module belongs to the [Zodiac](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) collection of tools. If you have any questions about Zodiac, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq). Follow [@GnosisGuild](https://twitter.com/gnosisguild) on Twitter for updates. For more information on the Reality Module (formerly SafeSnap) please refer to the original [Gnosis blog post](https://blog.gnosis.pm/ea67eb95c34f).

## Prerequisites

To start the process, you need to create a Safe on the Rinkeby test network (e.g. via https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io). This Safe will represent the DAO and hold all the assets (e.g. tokens and collectibles). A Safe transaction is required to set up the Reality Module.

For the hardhat tasks to work, the environment needs to be properly configured. See the [sample env file](../.env.sample) for more information.

The guide will use the Rinkeby ETH Reality.eth contract at [`0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da`](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da#code). Other network addresses can be found in the Truffle build folder on the [Reality.eth GitHub repo](https://github.com/realitio/realitio-contracts). For example, on Mainnet the ETH Reality.eth contract can be found at [`0x325a2e0f3cca2ddbaebb4dfc38df8d19ca165b47`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x325a2e0f3cca2ddbaebb4dfc38df8d19ca165b47#code).

DISCLAIMER: Check the deployed Reality.eth contracts before using them.

## Setting up the module

The first step is to deploy the module. The module is linked to one DAO (called executor in the contract) and an oracle (e.g. Reality.eth). These cannot be changed after deployment.

As part of the setup, you need to define or choose a template on Reality.eth. More information on templates can be found in [their docs](https://github.com/realitio/realitio-dapp#structuring-and-fetching-information). 

### Setup the Reality.eth template

To define your own template, a hardhat task is provided in the repository. It is possible to provide a template to that task via `--template`. Otherwise, the [default template](../src/tasks/defaultTemplate.json) is used.

The template should have the following format:
```json
{
    "title": "Did the proposal with the id %s pass the execution of the transactions with hash 0x%s?",
    "lang": "en",
    "type": "bool",
    "category": "DAO proposal"
}
```

- It is important that the `type` is `bool` as the module expects the outcome reported by Reality.eth to be `true`, `false` or `INVALID`.
- The `category` and `lang` can be freely choosen and are only used in the Reality.eth web interfaces.
- The title will also be displayed in the Reality.eth web interface and MUST include two `%s` placeholders.
  - The first placeholder is for the `id` of the proposal (e.g. an IPFS hash).
  - The second placeholder is the hash of the concatenation of the EIP-712 transaction hashes. See the [README](../README.md) for more information.
- IMPORTANT: The template should make it clear when and how to vote on your questions.
  - An example can be found in [üçØDAO requirements](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmeJwtwdG4mPzC8sESrW7zqixZqdHDYnREz6ar9GCewgz7/).
  - DISCLAIMER: DO NOT BLINDLY COPY THE REQUIREMENTS. You should check the requirements and make the adjustments for your setup.

Using this template you can run the task by using `yarn hardhat --network <network> createDaoTemplate --oracle <oracle address> --template <your template json>` and this should provide you with a template id.

For example, on Rinkeby using the default template this would be:
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby createDaoTemplate ---oracle 0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da`

For this guide we will assume that the returned template id is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`.

### Deploying the module

Hardhat tasks can be used to deploy a Reality Module instance. There are two different tasks, the first one is through a normal deployment and passing arguments to the constructor (with the task `setup`), or, deploy the module through a [Minimal Proxy Factory](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) and save on gas costs (with the task `factorySetup`).

On Rinkeby, the address of the Proxy Factory is: `0xd067410a85ffC8C55f7245DE4BfE16C95329D232`,and the address of the master copy of the Reality Module  is: `0x4D0D4Bd6eCA52f2F931c099B6a8a8B2ae85FFD4E`.

Now that we have a template, a hardhat task can be used to deploy a Reality Module instance. These tasks requires the following parameters:

- `avatar` - the address of the avatar.
- `owner` - the address of the owner
- `oracle` - the address of the Realitio contract
- `template` - the template to be used with Realitio

There are also optional parameters, for more information run `yarn hardhat setup --help` or `yarn hardhat factory-setup --help`.

An example for this on Rinkeby would be:
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby setup --owner <owner_address> --avatar <avatar_address> --oracle 0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da --template 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

or

`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby factorySetup --factory <factory_address> --mastercopy <mastercopy_address> --owner <owner_address> --avatar <avatar_address> --oracle 0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da --template 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

or

Once the module is deployed you should verify the source code. If you use a network that is Etherscan compatible and you configure the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in your environment, you can use the provided hardhat task to do this. 

An example for this on Rinkeby would be:
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby verifyEtherscan --module 0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242 --owner <owner_address> --avatar <avatar_address> --oracle 0x3D00D77ee771405628a4bA4913175EcC095538da --template 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

### Enabling the module

To allow the Reality Module to actually execute transaction, you must enable it on the Safe to which it is connected. For this, it is possible to use the Transaction Builder on https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io, which is accompanied by our tutorial on [adding a module](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4934427-add-a-module).

## Snapshot integration

Once the module is set up, it is possible to configure a space on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) with the Reality Module plugin. For this, the space configuration needs to include `"plugins": { "daoModule": { "address": "<module_address>"} }`. An example of this can be found in the [üçØDAO space configuration](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmahDCSkdED9BLZ3VtH6aJ8P5TmvMYEfA7fJa4hGsvEpi2/).

Once your space is configured, you can attach transactions to your proposals via the plugin section:

1. Open the plugin selection

![Open the plugin selection](./snapshot_plugin_section.png)

2. Add Reality Module plugin

![Add Reality Module (formerly DAO Module) plugin](./snapshot_add_plugin.png)

3. Add Reality Module (formerly DAO module) transaction

     alt="Add Reality Module transaction"
     width="250"/>
<img src="./snapshot_module_tx_details.png"
     alt="Enter transactiond etails"
     width="250" />
<img src="./snapshot_module_tx_confirm.png"
     alt="Check transaction details"
     width="250"/>

4. Check preview of transactions

![Transactions preview](./snapshot_plugin_preview.png)

Once the proposal has been resolved, it is possible to submit the proposal to the Reality Module via the plugin. 

This can also be done via the hardhat tasks provided in this repository. For more information, run `yarn hardhat addProposal --help` or `yarn hardhat executeProposal --help`.

Once the question is available it can be answered via the Reality.eth web interface: https://reality.eth.link/app/.

## Monitoring your module

As anyone can submit proposals to your module, it is strongly recommended to put in place monitoring practices. The Reality Module relies on the oracle (e.g. Reality.eth) to provide the correct answer, so that no malicious transactions are executed. In the worst case, the avatar (e.g. the connected Safe) can invalidate a submitted proposal. See the [README](../README.md) for more information on this. 

To make sure that all of the involved stakeholders can react in a timely manner, the events emitted by the module contract should be monitored. Each time a new proposal is submitted, the contract will emit a `ProposalQuestionCreated` event with the following parameters:
```
event ProposalQuestionCreated(
    bytes32 indexed questionId, // e.g. Realityeth question id
    string indexed proposalId // e.g. Snapshot proposal id
);
```

## Support

If you have any questions about the Reality Module or the Zodiac collection of tools, join the [Gnosis Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/wwmBWTgyEq).

There are different services available for this such as the [OpenZepplin Defender Sentinel](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/sentinel).

### Deploy a master copy 

The master copy contracts can be deployed through `yarn deploy` command. Note that this only should be done if the RealityModule contracts gets an update and the ones referred on the (zodiac repository)[https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/src/factory/constants.ts] should be used.
