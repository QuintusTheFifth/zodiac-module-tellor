# SafeSnap Setup Guide

This guide shows how to setup the Reality module with a Gnosis Safe on the Rinkeby testnetwork. It will use [Realitio](https://realit.io/) and can be used with [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/).

For more information on SafeSnap please refer to the [Gnosis blog](https://blog.gnosis.pm/ea67eb95c34f).

## Prerequisites

To start the process you need to create a Safe on the Rinkeby test network (e.g. via https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io). This Safe will represent the DAO and hold all the assets (e.g. tokens and collectibles). A Safe transaction is required to setup the Reality module.

For the hardhat tasks to work the environment needs to be properly configured. See the [sample env file](../.env.sample) for more information.

The guide will use the Rinkeby ETH RealitioV3 contract at [`0xDf33060F476F8cff7511F806C72719394da1Ad64`](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xDf33060F476F8cff7511F806C72719394da1Ad64#code). Other network addresses can be found in the truffle build folder on the [Realitio GitHub repo](https://github.com/RealityETH/monorepo/tree/main/packages/contracts/chains/deployments).

DISCLAIMER: Check the deployed Realitio contracts before using them.

## Setting up the module

The first step is to deploy the module. Every DAO will have their own module. The module is linked to a DAO (called executor in the contract) and an oracle (e.g. RealitioV3).

As part of the setup you need to define or choose a template on Realitio. More information can be found in [their docs](https://github.com/realitio/realitio-dapp#structuring-and-fetching-information).

### Setup the Realitio template

To define your own template a hardhat task is provided in the repository. It is possible to provide a template to that task via `--template` else the [default template](../src/tasks/defaultTemplate.json) is used.

The template should have the following format:
```json
{
    "title": "Did the proposal with the id %s pass the execution of the transactions with hash 0x%s?",
    "lang": "en",
    "type": "bool",
    "category": "DAO proposal"
}
```

- It is important that the `type` is `bool` as the module expects the outcome reported by Realitio to be `true`, `false` or `INVALID`
- The `category` and `lang` can be freely choosen and are only used in the Realitio web interfaces
- The title will also be displayed in the Realitio web interface and MUST include two `%s` placeholders
  - The first placeholder is for the `id` of the proposal (e.g. a ipfs hash)
  - The second placeholder is the hash of the concatenation of the EIP-712 transaction hashes (see the [README](../README.md) for more information)
- IMPORTANT: The template should make it clear when and how to vote on your questions
  - An example can be found in the [üçØDAO requirements](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmeJwtwdG4mPzC8sESrW7zqixZqdHDYnREz6ar9GCewgz7/)
  - DISCLAIMER: DO NOT BLINDLY COPY THE REQUIREMENTS. You should check the requirements and make the adjustments for your setup.

Using this template you can run the task by using `yarn hardhat --network <network> createDaoTemplate --oracle <oracle address> --template <your template json>` and this should provide you with a template id.

An example for this on Rinkeby would be (using the default template):
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby createDaoTemplate ---oracle 0xDf33060F476F8cff7511F806C72719394da1Ad64`

For this guide we will assume that the returned template id is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

You can also create your template from this (UI)[https://reality.eth.link/app/template-generator/]

### Deploying the module

The module has nine attributes which are:
- Owner: address that can call setter functions
- Avatar: address of the DAO (e.g Safe)
- Target: address that the module will call `execModuleTransaction()` on.
- Oracle: address of the oracle (e.g RealitioV3)
- Timeout: Timeout in seconds that should be required for the oracle
- Cooldown: Amount in seconds of cooldown required before the transaction can be executed
- Expiration: Duration that a transaction is valid in seconds (or 0 if valid forever) after the cooldown
- Bond: Minimum bond that is required for an answer to be accepted
- Template ID: ID of the template that should be used for proposal questions (see https://github.com/realitio/realitio-dapp#structuring-and-fetching-information)


Hardhat tasks can be used to deploy a Reality Module instance. There are two different ways to deploy the module, the first one is through a normal deployment and passing arguments to the constructor (without the `proxied` flag), or, deploy the module through a [Minimal Proxy Factory](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) and save on gas costs (with the `proxied` flag) - The master copy and factory address can be found in the [zodiac repository](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/src/factory/constants.ts) and these are the addresses that are going to be used when deploying the module through factory.

This task requires the following parameters:
- `owner` - the address of the owner
- `avatar` - the address of the avatar.
- `target` - the address of the target.
- `oracle` - the address of the RealitioV3 contract
- `template` - the template to be used with RealitioV3
- `iserc20` (optional) - If set to true, the module `RealityERC20` is going to be deployed, otherwise `RealityETH` is deployed. By default is false
- `proxied` (optional) - Deploys the module through a proxy factory

There are more optional parameters parameters, for more information run `yarn hardhat setup --help`.

An example for this on Rinkeby would be:
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby setup --owner <owner_address> --avatar <avatar_address> --target <target_address> --oracle 0xDf33060F476F8cff7511F806C72719394da1Ad64 --template 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

Once the module is deployed you should verify the source code (Note: Probably etherscan will verify it automatically, but just in case). If you use a network that is Etherscan compatible and you configure the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in your environment you can use the provided hardhat task to do this.

An example for this on Rinkeby would be:
`yarn hardhat --network rinkeby verifyEtherscan --module 0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242 --owner <owner_address> --avatar <avatar_address> --target <target_address> --oracle 0xDf33060F476F8cff7511F806C72719394da1Ad64 --template 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dad`

### Enabling the module

To allow the Reality module to actually execute transaction it is required to enable it on the Safe that it is connected to. For this it is possible to use the Transaction Builder on https://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io. For this you can follow our tutorial on [adding a module](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4934427-add-a-module).

## Snapshot integration

Once the module is setup it is possible to configure a space on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) to enable the Reality module plugin. For this the space configuration needs to include `"plugins": { "daoModule": { "address": "<module_address>"} }`. An example for this can be found in the [üçØDAO space configuration](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmahDCSkdED9BLZ3VtH6aJ8P5TmvMYEfA7fJa4hGsvEpi2/).

Once your space is configured you can attach transactions to you proposals via the plugin section:

1. Open the plugin selection

![Open the plugin selection](./snapshot_plugin_section.png)


2. Add Reality module plugin

![Add Reality module plugin](./snapshot_add_plugin.png)

3. Add Reality module transaction

<img src="./snapshot_module_add_tx.png"
     alt="Add Reality module transaction"
     width="250"/>
<img src="./snapshot_module_tx_details.png"
     alt="Enter transactiond etails"
     width="250" />
<img src="./snapshot_module_tx_confirm.png"
     alt="Check transaction details"
     width="250"/>

4. Check preview of transactions

![Transactions preview](./snapshot_plugin_preview.png)

Once the proposal has been resolved it is possible to submit the proposal to the Reality module via the plugin. 

This can also be done via the hardhat tasks provided in this repository. For more information run `yarn hardhat addProposal --help` or `yarn hardhat executeProposal --help`.

Once the question is available it can be answered via the Realitio web interface (e.g. https://reality.eth.link/app/).

## Monitoring your module

As anyone can submit proposals to your module it is recommended to setup some monitoring. The Reality module relies on the oracle (e.g. Realitio) to provide the correct answer so that no malicious transactions are executed. In the worst case the avatar (e.g. the connected Safe) can invalidate a submitted proposal (see [README](../README.md) for more information). 

To make sure that all the involved stakeholders can react in a timely manner, the events emitted by the module contract should be monitored. Each time a new proposal is submitted the contract will emit a `ProposalQuestionCreated` event with the following parameters:
```
event ProposalQuestionCreated(
    bytes32 indexed questionId, // e.g. Realitio question id
    string indexed proposalId // e.g. Snapshot proposal id
);
```

There are different services available for this such as the [OpenZepplin Defender Sentinel](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/sentinel).

### Deploy a master copy 

The master copy contracts can be deployed through `yarn deploy` command. Note that this only should be done if the RealityModule contracts gets an update and the ones referred on the (zodiac repository)[https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/src/factory/constants.ts] should be used.
